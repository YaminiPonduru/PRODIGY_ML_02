### Internship Tasks

In this project, I developed a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset I used is from Kaggleâ€™s [Customer Segmentation Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). By clustering customers with similar purchasing patterns, the model provides valuable insights that can help in tailoring marketing strategies more effectively. I employed Python and key libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to preprocess the data, implement the clustering algorithm, and visualize the results. This project has significantly deepened my understanding of customer segmentation and the application of clustering techniques.
